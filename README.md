# Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python

## 📘 Module 4: Functions & Modules

This assignment includes two tasks:

---

## ✅ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a **loop or recursion**.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a **sample number** and prints the output.

### 🧪 Example Output

If the function is called with the number `5`, the output should be:

Factorial of 5 is: 120

## ✅ Task 2: Using the `math` Module for Calculations

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Uses the built-in `math` module to compute and display:
   - ✅ The **square root** of the number
   - ✅ The **natural logarithm (ln)** of the number
   - ✅ The **sine** of the number (interpreted as radians)

### 🧪 Example Output

If the user enters `25`, the output should be:

Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
